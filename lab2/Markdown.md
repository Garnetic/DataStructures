# High-Level Approach(es)
- If the strings are different lengths, return false
- Otherwise, for each character in the given string(s)
  - Compare each character of string 's' to the each character of 't'
  - If the for loop iterates to the end of the string 't' without any matches, return false
- Once the for loop has verified the strings, return true
