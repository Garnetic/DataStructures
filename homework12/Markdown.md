# High-Level Approach(es)
- Create an edgelist to store edges
- Add wells to the edgelist
- Add in the edges from the given 2D array into the edgeList
- Sort the edges from smallest to largest (cost)
- Create an array to keep track of nodes in the MST
- Create a total cost, initialized at 0
- Iterate through the edges (now sorted)
  - Store the current edge and it's connections (to & from)
  - Check if the current edge would form a cycle
  - If not, then add the edge to the MST
  - And add the cost of the edge to the total cost
- Then return the total cost of the edges added to the MST
